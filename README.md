1.	Background description

“In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation”.

The project uses a Adeept Mega 2560 Board connected to the computer from a USB cable while on the breadboard there are the Thermistor, which measures the temperature in Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit, the LCD1602, which displays the temperature, the Potentiometer (10K Ω) which changes the contrast of the LCD display, a small button, which changes the degrees from Celsius to Kelvin then to Fahrenheit and finally back to Celsius every time it is pressed, a Resistor (220 Ω). Last but no least, there are male to male jumper wires to make the connections.

The temperature converter has no OFF state, since it is plugged in it is in the ON state and it cannot be turned off, it can only be shut down by removing the USB cable.

	


 
2.	Definition of purpose

The purpose of the project is to make a temperature converter that shows the degrees in Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit and can switch between them in real time, while showing it on a LCD display.


 
3.	Problem Statement
The temperature converter is a system for people to use to switch up real quick between different measurement scales, the ones being used are the more common ones: Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit. 
    1. How to make the display work properly without losing color
    2. How to properly place the items on the breadboard
    3. How to correctly code using only Assembly

5.	Requirements
Functional requirements
•	The temperature converter should be able to change the temperature between Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit
•	The display should work properly and be visible enough


Non-functional requirements
•	The only coding language that should be used is Assembly
•	The only components used should be the ones from the Adeept kit.

7.	Risk assessment

We decided to use a 1 to 5 rating system to describe the severity of the risks, 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.



Risks	Description	Likelihood	Severity	Risk mitigation	Identifiers	Responsible
Risk 1	Lack of knowledge	5	5	Keep working as a team on every exercise	Impossibility of creating the system	The entire team
Risk 2	Bad time management	4	5	Agreeing on reasonable windows in our schedules	Not finishing our checkpoints on time	The entire team
Risk 3	Lack of communication	4	4	Understanding our strong points	Misunderstanding each other	Individual members
Risk 4	Losing part of / all data	1	4	Storing all the information online	A member’s computer breaks down	Depends on the event
